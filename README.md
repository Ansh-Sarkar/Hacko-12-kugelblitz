# About the Project : CloseBuy 
Our project aims to provide an end-to-end hyperlocal platform to connect local entrepreneurs with customers within their location and equipping them with tools to bring their services online and find customers quickly and easily.

# The Problem Statement :
1. Local entreprenuers lack exposure of their small businesses due to societal constraints. 
2. These local entreprenuers find difficulty in acquiring initial customers and scaling their business.
3. Normal consumers have to spend a lot of time looking for a good tailor for tight deadlines for an event or house helps , baby sitters or any other work , nearby.

## How it all works : 
1. Customers could “Make a Wish” for the service they’re looking for from the comforts of their home.
2. Local entrepreneurs within a certain vicinity could see the request and respond, thus being a platform for fulfilment.
3. Entrepreneurs could connect with manufacturers/suppliers for raw materials from the comfort of their mobile phones.
4. Secured and Logged Transactions for every wish created on our very own BlockChain

# SWOT Analysis
1. Strengths : Providing support to local talent and providing opportunities for extra income . The platform can also be used as means of finding local freelance opprtunities.
2. Weakness : As with any new model , proper focus needs to be given in order to improve and make the peer to peer local interactions as smooth and efficient as possibe. This   is surely a huge task , but we at CloseBuy are committed to make this happen .
3. Opportunities : There exists a single global market while on the other hand , there exists millions of local ones. Catering to people at a local scale makes the model more scalable and more efficient while also providing employment and economic opportunities to people .
